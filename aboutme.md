I graduated with my PhD in Epidemiology from UCLA in May 2019. During my PhD, I studied the language and statistics of causation, learning how to answer questions of whether A caused B and with what strength. My dissertation involved innovating in a sub-field of causal inference known as bias analysis. I found this area particularly attractive because it allows for greater transparency in epidemiological studies. Instead of simplying positing that one or more biases may be impacting one's results, it forces researchers to quantify these assumptions. Ultimately, the reader is able to use this information in conjunction with a p-value or confidence interval to understand how robust a causal estimate really is.  

During graduate school I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in data science. This seemed like a logical choice for me since I found myself naturally gravitating towards mastering statistical programming and building computational tools. I incorporated these skills in my dissertation through simulation studies and the creation of an R package and Shiny app. Fortunately, I was accepted into the Health Data Science Fellowship through [Insight Data Science](https://www.insightdatascience.com) to assist in this transition.

Throughout all these experiences, I've had a strong passion for baseball statistics and fantasy baseball. During graduate school, I always chose baseball as the subject of my final project in biostatistics classes. I plan on using my experience to contribute new types of analyses to the fantasy baseball community and continuing to use baseball data as I learn new statistical techniques. This website includes the portfolio of these baseball projects in addition to my work in causal inference.
