Whle at Insight, I had the opportunity to create a data science project that demonstrates my ability to perform an analysis that creates business value within a short timeframe (about three weeks), simulating how data science operates in an industry setting. For this project I consulted with [Zendo Tools](http://zendo.tools/), a company with an app that helps to track a user's meditation progress.
